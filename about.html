    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Our mission is to redefine family transportation with trust, care, and convenience. We believe parents deserve peace of mind
      when sending their children to school, practice, or any daily destination. That means certified drivers, modern safety-first
      vehicles, and transparent communication every step of the ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanny Driver isn’t just a ride service — it's a support system. We're here for working parents, single guardians, military
      families, and anyone who needs a helping hand. We’re committed to creating safer streets, reliable routines, and a sense of
      partnership between our drivers and every family we serve.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Nanny Driver was born out of a moment many parents can relate to — juggling work, school drop-offs, after-school pickups,
      and trying to keep dinner warm on the stove. I was doing it all myself. Driving my daughter across town, rushing between
      meetings, and constantly worrying if I was doing enough. It was overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s when I realized something had to change. I needed help I could trust — not just a rideshare, but someone who truly
      understood the responsibility of transporting a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, I created Nanny Driver. For me, and for every parent who’s ever felt the same stress, pressure, and guilt. This isn’t
      just a business — it’s a promise to parents like me who just want to do right by their kids.

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Being a parent today isn’t just about love — it’s about logistics. It’s planning routes, managing calendars, rearranging
      meetings, and always putting your child’s needs above your own. But what if you didn’t have to do it all alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nanny Driver exists for the families who have no backup plan. For the parent working a double shift. For the caregiver
      trying to juggle school pick-ups across town. For the families who care deeply about their child’s safety but can’t be in
      two places at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don’t need just another ride. You need someone who understands the stakes. Someone who sees your child not as a
      passenger, but as your world. That’s what Nanny Driver is — a service built on trust, reliability, and empathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re here so you can finally breathe. So you can stop rushing. So you can show up — at work, at home, and in your child’s
      life — fully present, not constantly pulled in five directions.
