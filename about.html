    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      At Nanny Driver, our mission is to create the safest, most reliable, and most parent-centered transportation
      experience for families. We understand that modern parenting comes with a never-ending to-do list — school drop-offs,
      after-school practices, doctor appointments, tutoring sessions — all while trying to maintain a career, a household,
      and your own sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe every parent deserves peace of mind knowing their child is transported by trusted, background-checked,
      CPR-certified professionals. Whether you're a single parent juggling work hours, a couple trying to coordinate
      multiple kids’ schedules, or a grandparent stepping in to help — Nanny Driver is here to make daily life smoother,
      safer, and less stressful.
    </p>
    <p>
      We aren’t just a ride service. We’re your extended village — committed to bringing safety, convenience, and care to
      your family’s everyday routine.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Nanny Driver was born from experience — the real, raw kind. One day I found myself juggling a full-time job, rushing
      to get my daughter to school on time, then racing to make it to work, only to leave again hours later to pick her up
      and get her to after-school activities. On top of that, I still had to figure out dinner, homework, and somehow take
      a breath. I was overwhelmed, exhausted, and constantly worried — not just about my time, but about my child’s safety
      and well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s when I realized: there had to be a better way. Not every family has extra hands to help. Not every parent has
      flexible hours. But every child deserves safe, dependable rides. And every parent deserves support they can trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I built Nanny Driver — not just as a business, but as a solution. A service designed to step in when life gets
      chaotic. A service that understands what it means to be stretched thin and still want the very best for your child.
      Because I’ve lived it. And now, I want to help lift that weight for other families too.

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Being a parent today isn’t just about love — it’s about logistics. It’s planning routes, managing calendars, rearranging
    meetings, and always putting your child’s needs above your own. But what if you didn’t have to do it all alone?
  </p>
  <p>
    Nanny Driver exists for the families who have no backup plan. For the parent working a double shift. For the caregiver
    trying to juggle school pick-ups across town. For the families who care deeply about their child’s safety but can’t be in
    two places at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    You don’t need just another ride. You need someone who understands the stakes. Someone who sees your child not as a
    passenger, but as your world. That’s what Nanny Driver is — a service built on trust, reliability, and empathy.
  </p>
  <p>
    We’re here so you can finally breathe. So you can stop rushing. So you can show up — at work, at home, and in your child’s
    life — fully present, not constantly pulled in five directions.
