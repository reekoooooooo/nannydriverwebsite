    <h2>Because Your Child’s Safety Comes First</h2>
    <p>
      We know what it means to hand your child off to someone else — that’s why every inch of Nanny Driver is built around one thing: <strong>trust</strong>. From trained drivers to live tracking, we’ve designed every ride to give you peace of mind.

    <h2>Our Safety Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Background-Checked Drivers:</strong> Every driver passes multi-layered national, state, and local background checks. We go deeper than rideshare apps.</li>
      <li><strong>CPR & First Aid Certified:</strong> All drivers are certified in CPR and pediatric emergency care — so they’re prepared for the unexpected.</li>
      <li><strong>Behavior & Situational Training:</strong> We train our drivers in communication, child behavior, and emergency response scenarios.</li>
      <li><strong>Always Watching – Dashcams:</strong> Every vehicle is equipped with interior and exterior dashcams that are reviewed regularly for safety compliance.</li>
      <li><strong>Live Tracking:</strong> Parents can view the ride in real time, with alerts for pickups, drop-offs, and stops along the way.</li>
      <li><strong>In-App SOS Button:</strong> Both drivers and riders have access to an SOS feature that immediately alerts our safety team and notifies parents.</li>
      <li><strong>Ride Logs and Audits:</strong> Every ride is logged and monitored for quality control, allowing us to investigate and respond to any incident quickly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Trust. Our Promise.</h2>
    <p>
      We’re not just a ride — we’re your partner in parenting. Nanny Driver is driven by one belief: if we wouldn’t put our own child in that car, we won’t put yours in it either.
