        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>In-App Safety Features & Secure Communication:</strong> Control and support are always at your fingertips.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>In-App SOS Alert Button for Driver & Parent:</strong> Both drivers and parents/guardians have access to an SOS alert feature within the Nanny Driver app. Activating it immediately notifies our dedicated 24/7 safety support team and can also alert designated emergency contacts.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure Ride Monitoring & Detailed Logs:</strong> Every trip is digitally logged, capturing route details, duration, driver information, and any in-app communications. This data is used for quality assurance, service improvement, and allows for swift, thorough investigation and response to any reported incidents or concerns.</li>
          <li><strong>Direct & Secure Communication Channels:</strong> The app provides secure and direct communication options between parents and their assigned driver for essential, ride-related updates, ensuring privacy and clarity.</li>

    <h2>Your Trust. Our Promise.</h2>
    <p>
      We’re not just a ride — we’re your partner in parenting. Nanny Driver is driven by one belief: if we wouldn’t put our own child in that car, with that driver, under those policies, we won’t put yours in it either. Your child's safety and your peace of mind are the measures of our success.
