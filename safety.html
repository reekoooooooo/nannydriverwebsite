    <h2>Because Your Child’s Safety Comes First</h2>
    <p>
      We know what it means to hand your child off to someone else — that’s why every inch of Nanny Driver is built around one thing: <strong>trust</strong>. From trained drivers to live tracking, we’ve designed every ride to give you peace of mind.

    <h3>A Parent’s Story</h3>
    <p>
      “I started Nanny Driver because I was tired of rushing from work, worrying if my son made it to soccer practice on time. One day, my sitter canceled last-minute, and I had no options — that feeling stuck with me. This service is built to make sure no parent has to feel that again.”

    <h2>Our Safety Commitments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong> Background-Checked Drivers:</strong> Every driver passes multi-layered national, state, and local background checks. We go deeper than rideshare apps.</li>
      <li><strong> CPR & First Aid Certified:</strong> All drivers are certified in CPR and pediatric emergency care — so they’re ready for the unexpected.</li>
      <li><strong> Behavior & Situational Training:</strong> We train our drivers in communication, child behavior, and emergency response scenarios.</li>
      <li><strong> Always Watching: Dashcams</strong> in every vehicle record rides (front and rear) and are reviewed routinely for compliance and safety.</li>
      <li><strong> Live Tracking:</strong> Parents can see the car’s location and get notifications at pickup, drop-off, and during stops.</li>
      <li><strong> In-App SOS:</strong> Your child or driver can tap a panic button inside the app — instantly alerting our safety team and you.</li>
      <li><strong> Ride History & Logs:</strong> Every ride is logged and stored for safety audits. Nothing slips through the cracks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Trust. Our Promise.</h2>
    <p>
      We’re not just a ride — we’re your partner in parenting. Nanny Driver is driven by one belief: if we wouldn’t put our own child in that car, we won’t put yours in it either.
